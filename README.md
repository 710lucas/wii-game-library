# Introduction

Hi! This is still an idea, but I'll try to make like a library that can be used with GRRLIB to make the process of creating games for the nintendo wii easier

As I said, it's just an idea, don't expect it to be perfect of even to be finished

## Disclaimer

I wrote this in a hurry, this is going to improve in the future

# How to use it

## 0 - Requirements

You'll need Devkitpro and GRRLIB installed

[Click here to install devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

[Click here to install GRRLIB](https://github.com/GRRLIB/GRRLIB)

The only important files are inside the src/ folder, you can copy them to the source/folder that comes with the template provided by GRRLIB


## 1 - Clone the repo

For instance, this is the best way to start with something simple, since the makefile is configured with those folders

If you want, you can just copy every .cpp and .h file inside the src/ folder to your source/ folder, that comes in the GRRLIB template 

## 2 - Code!

You can [check our documentation](https://github.com/Luxs710/wii-game-library/wiki) to know more about each function

or you can see some examples, inside the template/ folder

joguin.cpp is a brick breaker

main.cpp are just some tests 

## 3 - Compiling

To compile, just go inside the template/ folder and execute the ```make``` command

then, you can execute the template.dol file in your wii or on dolphin
